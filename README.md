Video Automation Tool : 
Introducing the After Effects Video Automation Tool, a powerful new software solution for streamlining the video creation process. This tool is designed to make the process of creating high-quality videos more efficient and less time-consuming. With this tool, we can create professional-looking videos by simply passing a valid JSON file. The tool offers a wide range of options for controlling images, audio files, time, frame rate, and font, all of which can be easily configured through the JSON file. This makes it easy for team members with little to no video editing experience to create polished, professional-looking videos.
